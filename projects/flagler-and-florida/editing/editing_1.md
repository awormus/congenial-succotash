# FLAGLER AND FLORIDA

By EDWIN LEFEVRE

Author of "The Golden Flood," "Sampson Rock of Wall Street," etc.

FATE gave to Ponce de Leon for a ward the daughter of a companion who had died in his arms on the field of battle. On a visit to Spain, his last, he saw her. She was very beautiful — and very young. Fame, wealth, power: husks! Love: heaven! After a while his ward consented to be his wife. But he, in his middle age, would be loved as only youth loves and is loved. Once more he sailed over the salt seas, ordered by the king on the old quests and by Eros on a new. The Caribs whom he subdued had often spoken of a magic land where was the Fountain of Perpetual Youth! A delectable vision came to him, and, following its irresistible beckoning, he dis covered on Easter Sunday -- Pascua Florida, in Spanish - March 27, 1513, the land he sought. In honor of the day and because it was a land green and beautiful, he called it Florida. 

He did not find youth. But, in seeking it, he grasped Immortality.

Nearly four centuries later, from the gray North, a man named Flagler, a commercial discoverer, an industrial conquistador, past the age of Ponce de Leon, also went to Florida. It may be he sought the precious gold of the sunlight or the turquoise of the sky; perhaps merely a comfortable rocking chair in a hotel piazza. But he found what his brother-conquistador missed. It did not gush from a fountain, but blossomed on the tree of his life's philosophy, which later bore marvelous fruit, as you shall see. He found: his Second Youth. And, like Ponce de Leon, he also grasped Immortality. 

What he has done you may see for your self; and the children of your children will see still more clearly. The tramp of the marching years will not grind to dust his work, but make it the more solid-like the concrete of his viaducts and his buildings, which will grow harder, more like stone, with age. In no other place, in no other way, by no other man could the work have been done. 

Of this work the American people know very little; of the man's self, nothing. Florida is far away, and Flagler's is not only an excessive modesty but a personality so elusive as to be unseizable by the ordinary grappling hooks of character analysts. He has no intimates. The friends of his youth, the business associates of his active middle age, the men who are leading his forces down the East Coast of Florida, do not know him. They know some of him; not one of them knows all of him. They do not realize the two youths of him! 

The two youths-in no other way can you reconcile 1879 with 1909, or secure consistency in seeming inconsistency. His photographs show the difference. You see more than the mere change of thirty years. Where once he had the look of the Money Maker, now he has the look of the Money Spender! The same efficient human machine; the same vision; the same thoroughness; the same passion for permanence - and suddenly a different work and different results; and infinitely greater success. Supposing you accept, as I did, EVERYBODY's invitation to go to Florida in mid-winter and see what is there, and learn how it happened, and meet Henry Morrison Flagler. 

When you cross the Georgia line, begin, subconsciously, to Floridize yourself. You prepare for the scenery on the railroad folders to become moving-picturesque. But it is only as you approach St. Augustine that the car-window messages begin to interest you. Among clumps of verdure you catch a glimpse of red-tiled roofs and Spanish towers: the “Ponce de Leon” and the "Alcazar." Flagler: his hotels! 

And a beautiful dome, dominating as the Duomo of Florence, though without the sea of Florentine roofs about it: the Memorial Church, perhaps the most beautiful small church in America. More Flagler!

WHITEHALL," THE RESIDENCE OF H. M. FLAGLER AT PALM BEACH, FLORIDA.

You stop in St. Augustine to rest before proceeding south. (It sounds curious to say south, here!) It is an old town, St. Augustine: “The oldest city in the United States,” they are careful to tell you. Also they point out a dozen “oldest” houses, none particularly interesting, and the old Spanish fort and the old slave market which probably wasn't a slave market at all. In point of fact, the spirit of the place does not bear down very heavily on you with the weight of antiquity. No huge ash shifter has been shaken over it, covering everything with the fine dust of disintegrated centuries, as in the medieval towns of Eu rope. Nevertheless, something here is different; I think it is because everywhere you see palms. 

And utilizing to the utmost this palm motif are the Flagler hotels. They fit, these beautiful edifices, Spanish in architecture and gorgeously successful in the utter unAmericanness of their environment and general effect. Barely twenty years old, they look as if they had always been there, in that precise spot. They “belong,” very decidedly. 

And the crowd that you see is a crowd of all kinds of people, who are not altogether pleasure-hunting nor exclusively health-seeking, neither prosperous-looking nor shabby. In all the hotels you see more gray heads than black or brown or blond. They tell you, on the slightest provocation, how many years they have been coming down here for the winter. And you gather, before your first day has passed, that Florida is not merely a Fashionable Fad. It is a National Institution. 

From St. Augustine you go south to Ormond. On this trip you first begin to bear the natives' remarks about the wonderful way the trains have of being on time, and the great number of cars, passenger and freight, they are running. You feel almost as if you were on the first train that ever ran to the latest mining town. The Florida of yesterday you thus visualize so clearly that your respect for Flagler grows, long before you have come to his crowning triumphs.

If you are a motorist, you will see the Ormond beach, return thanks to the Maker thereof, and refuse to use the rest of your railroad ticket, for you have here the most wonderful speedway in the world: flat, smooth, just hard enough, and swept clean every day by the mighty broom of the tide. The Ormond Hotel is between the beach and the Halifax River. It is comfortable, more homelike than any other Flagler hotel, and the grounds have a more exotic look than in St. Augustine. You drive to Daytona along beautiful shell roads, past orange groves and the cottages of the winter residents, through streets bordered by trees heavily hung with Spanish moss. Beautiful places, Daytona and Ormond, with river and ocean “views"; but you must push southward, to Palm Beach. It is the heart of our Riviera. The train stops at the very gates of the Royal Poinciana - the largest wooden building in the world used exclusively for hotel purposes. You notice long, colonnaded porches; and no architectural pretensions - a hotel that has grown by means of additions as it grew in popularity. 

If the Royal Poinciana Hotel neither awes you by its size nor charms you by its architecture, the grounds completely delight you. Yesterday a swamp was here; today you see the wizardry of the dollar. To make a lawn here was more difficult than it would have been to spread a sheet of solid silver on this spot, or on the golf links, where Mr. Flagler's engineers dumped thousands of carloads of earth. Lawns you have seen before; but not these curious trees and strange shrubs with polychromatic leaves; uncanny screw pines with clumps of exposed roots like writhing serpents upholding the trunk; the gaudy crimson blossoms of the hibiscus that suggest the red lights on a Christmas tree; palms of divers kinds; borders of century plants grown to huge size. And over it all the azure splendor of the Florida sky canopying a scene of so exotic a beauty that you are not merely miles, but whole worlds, away from New York. 

### FLAGLER AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER AS MONEY MAKER.

Hither comes the ultra-fashion of the great cities to wear its summer gowns six months ahead of time; to see and to be seen. The crowd alone is worth the trip. You get to know Doucet and Paquin better than you know your pastor, and a trip through the corridors in the evening is merely a journey from Paris to Palm Beach by way of the rue de la Paix via Fifth Avenue. 

In an Ethiopian-propelled wheel chair you go forth to see Palm Beach; no horses are allowed here. The hotel is on Lake Worth, and you take the drive along the shore Bluebill ducks swim about and dive with an air of doing it for your beneft. You see the garfish poking their noses into everything; the oldest of extant fishes, unchanged and "unevoluted" these hundred thousand years, they now help to intensify feeling of being in a strange world. The lake shows curious patches of varying blueness. . . There is no sky: only a stupendous turquoise incandescence; and along the horizon a paler strip-crushed jewels and vaporized silver-otherwise you could not tell where sky began or water left off. And where you should see clouds, you see instead soft whitenesses, glinting like new snow in bright sunlight. 

On both sides of the Lake Drive grow cocoanut palms, graceful, lithe, almost animate. You see them gazing at themselves in the mirror of the lake, perennially fasci nated by their beauty. But others distinctly lean away from the water: veritable women in the act of fleeing, suddenly metamor phosed into palms. Along the glaring white road, through tunnels of verdure, the noiseless wheel chair carries you, each strange tree adding impressions of a land utterly foreign. It is as if your soul were receiving mysterious little taps-tap! tap! tap! -- psychic hammer-strokes that numb other thoughts and lull your senses into the  the Floridian mood. The lake and the sky are having fights in blue. A draw! ... You return and drive through palm-bordered streets to the “Jungle Trail” - a manmade labyrinthine road, cut tunnel-like through banks of vegetation; past weird, misshapen trees out to the “Breakers,” the other Flagler hotel, and the pier. The ocean is very blue, save near the horizon, where it is green. There is the smell of the sea and the roar of the sea—that and the sky and its eternal azure challenge to the water.

ON BOTH IDES OF THE LAKE DRIVE AT PALM BEACH GROW COCOANUT PALMS, GRACEFUL, LITHE, ALMOST ANIMATE.

It is a place, Palm Beach, unlike any other in the world. And only the other day it was merely sand and marsh and brush, with a few palms that grew from cocoanuts which drifted ashore from the wreck of a West Indian schooner. Only that and the blue sky and the blue lake and the blue ocean. And Flagler came and saw what there was. And then he saw what there would be. 

You push on to Miami, in what was, till recently, the southernmost section under Flagler development. It is not so picturesque a place as Palm Beach. But it impresses you as being infinitely more useful. It is a business town, but the business is fruit growing, and therefore you see no smokebelching factory chimneys. The roads are absolutely white -- literal streaks of blinding glare in the sunlight. You are no longer warm; you are hot. Where nothing was, a few years ago, you see streets, brick buildings, hotels, banks, churches, schools, cottages not of "resorters" but of residents. It is no longer an experiment; it is a fact proved less by the money spent by Flagler than by the money earned by the farmers and fruit growers. The Royal Palm -- the local Flagler hotel -- strikes you as the only "resort” feature here. 

You push southward. Seen from the car windows, the Keys are shoreless islands of verdure, for all the world suggesting a flooded meadow with clumps of trees rising above the flood. The water itself is the greatest charm, with its varying shades of blue and green, according to the depth. In many places it shows chalky white, especially after a storm, which stirs up the marl in the bottom. You see no habitations; no sign human life until you stop at Long Key, from which the famous viaduct starts. 

### AN OLD CANAL-ONE OF THE SPANISH SURVIVALS THAT LEND GLAMOUR TO FLORIDA.

Long Key is now the most popular fishing camp in Florida, with its comfortable, homelike hotel. The white coral beach and the cocoanut palms recall to your mind South Sea atolls. And you sit on the porch of your cottage, and look across the waters that shade from light green to blue; and you see the Gulf Stream like a clearly defined sapphirine streak (the Gulf blue!), and you are confronted by the might of the invincible ocean - until, happening to turn, you see the concrete viaduct built into that same invincible ocean. 

There is a suggestion of soldiers in that series of arches; the piers are as a regiment marching across the land and across the water, southward, at the command of a man who had a vision that could see gardens and palaces and fruit groves in this wilderness, and who, when the sea bade him halt, did not order it lashed with whips but put his hand in his pocket and said to the Atlantic: "Stay where you are. You're not disturbing me, worth talking about.” And when your train goes over it, and you look out of the car windows and see the ocean to your right and to your left and beneath you, you marvel at the power of one man's money a little, and at the spirit of that same man a great deal.

If you would know more about this remarkable railroad, read Mr. Paine's article in EVERYBODY's for February, 1908. When I was down there, the late J.C. Meredith, construction engineer, had his headquarters at Knight's Key. In and out of the construction camps he flitted in his launch, his binoculars to his eyes, like a general observing the movements of his troops on the battle-field. You could see telephone poles sticking out of the water in the shallow places, for all the world like lines of skirmishers and scouts. On the deck of his launch, inspecting the work, he explained remarkable achievements in a remarkably matter-of-fact way. Then he spoke about himself: 

“It was very strange, at first, for me to work for Mr. Flagler, on account of his point of view. With him it is never a case of How much will it cost? nor of Will it pay? — which are the inevitable and perfectly proper questions for corporations to ask of their engineers. I had done some work in Tampico Harbor, Mexico, and they sent for me to come to Florida. They told me about the Key West extension. Not a word about cost or possible profits; merely the matter of engineering feasibility. Mr. Flagler wanted either to fill in or to build a viaduct, for he hates makeshifts. Permanence appeals to him more strongly than to any other man I ever met. He has often told me that he does not wish to keep on spending money for maintenance of way, but to build for all time; while a corporation, especially where the country has to grow up and the paying traffic is all in the future, will do barely enough to supply the pressing needs, and make improvements gradually, as the profit comes in. But that is not Mr. Flagler's way “I was told to make my studies and my estimates. We had lots of problems to solve, and I was quite a long time at it, and I knew how much he desired to see the work rushed, but I never heard a word from him; not one request for haste. When the report was ready, Mr. Parrott and I took it to Mr. Flagler. He heard how we proposed to do it. We stopped before we came to the estimates of cost. And Mr. Flagler stood up and looked at us and said: 'Well, let's get to work!' It was the most serious work he had planned to do in Florida. Perhaps he felt the occasion called for some comment, for he looked at me and said very quietly: 'I want to see it done before I die.' That is all he said."

PUTTING-GREEN AT NASSAU, BAHAMA ISLANDS— NEAR ONE OF THE FLAGLER HOTELS.

The engineer was an unemotional, deliberate man of the von Moltke type. He paused and looked at me. Then he said, very earnestly: "Mr. Lefèvre, there isn't one of us who wouldn't give a year of his life to have Mr. Flagler see the work completed!" 

It is to be doubted whether mere figures can give an adequate idea of the magnitude of Flagler's work. He has spent $41,000,000 in Florida; that is, his investment in incorporated enterprise amounts to that, divided roughly as follows: $18,000,000 in the old railroads, including the development of towns, $10,000,000 in the Key West Extension, $12,000,000 in hotels, and $1,000,000 in steamboat and outside enterprises. This sum does not include his charities, churches, and divers donations, for neither he nor any one else has kept the figures. The value of the taxable property in the counties exclusively reached by, the Flagler roads has in creased over fifty millions since he began. And there are today only about 25,000 acres under cultivation for fruit and vegetables out of a total of about 3,500,000 acres now available for such cultivation. Flagler has "made" the East Coast of Florida.

COURT OF THE PONCE DE LEON AT ST. AUGUSTINE, FLORIDA.

The construction of the Ponce de Leon Hotel began in 1885. The house opened in December, 1888. The Alcazar was completed shortly after. The Ormond Hotel was purchased in 1890, and enlarged from time to time. The Royal Poinciana at Palm Beach, originally a five-hundred-room house, was opened in February, 1894; it now has 2,000 rooms. The Breakers was completed in 1895, destroyed by fire in 1903, and entirely rebuilt on the old site. is a four-hundred-room house. The Royal Palm at Miami was completed and opened for the season of 1896–97. At Nassau, the Colonial, a four-hundred-room house, was opened in 1899. Flagler purchased other property there, including the Hotel Victoria, from the English Government. The Continental, at Atlantic Beach, Florida, a two-hundred room summer hotel, opened in May, 1901. In May, 1886, Mr. Flagler acquired the Jacksonville, St. Augustine & Halifax River Railroad, and in 1888 the St. Augustine & Palatka Railroad, with a branch of twelve miles to Tocoi. The same year he acquired the St. John's & Halifax, from East Palatka to Daytona, also a narrow-gauge road, standardized in 1889. In 1888 a bridge was built across the river at Palatka. In 1889 and 1890 a steel bridge was constructed across the St. John's River at Jacksonville. Up to 1892 he merely bought old properties, which he improved and strengthened, but in 1892 he began the construction of the line south from Daytona. In 1894 the road was completed to Palm Beach, and in 1896 to Miami. In 1905 began the construction of the Key West Extension.

THE CATHEDRAL AT ST. AUGUSTINE, IN THE SPANISH STYLE TO WHICH FLAGLER'S HOTELS CONFORM.

In 1897 the railroad moved 76,000 crates of vegetables; in 1909, about 1,500,000 crates of tomatoes alone; 150,000 barrels of Irish potatoes from station alone; 700,000 crates of pineapples, besides other fruits and vegetables. The road earned, gross, $819,000 in 1907 and over $3,000,000 in 1908. Over 1,000,000 passengers were carried in 1908. 

Steamship service was first inaugurated to Nassau in 1895 by the Florida East Coast Steamship Company, owned by Flagler. In 1896 the Key West line was opened, and, in the winter of that year, the operation was extended to the Havana line. There is now a daily service. In 1902 the Florida EastCoast Steamship Company was consolidated with the Plant Steamship Company. Flagler owns one half of the stock of the consolidation. 

George W. Perkins, of J. P. Morgan & Co., said not long ago: “I can understand how, for instance, James J. Hill built his railroad into the uninhabited prairies, for he knew what the soil was capable of, and it was a country similar to what men else where were used to. But that any man could have the genius to see of what this wilderness of waterless sand and underbrush was capable and then have the nerve to build a railroad here, is more marvelous than similar development anywhere else in the world." 

For you must remember that Flagler owns the hotels and the railroad. He has never done any promoting. He has never asked any one to buy stock in his company. He has “incorporated” himself in order to be business-like in his spending. The magnitude and the picturesqueness of the work, its absolutely unique quality, grow the more it is studied. It was not merely a rich man's hobby, nor strictly a commercial enterprise. Why, then, is this work at all? To explain this you must explain Flagler himself. 

## II 

AND nobody knows Flagler! In the Standard Oil offices you hear: “A fine man!” or “A wonderful man!” But no body can visualize an adjective. Being in Florida, you naturally turn to the Flagler lieutenants. Your credentials entitling you to their confidence, they speak very frankly. You are immediately struck by the curious note of apology in their voice and manner as though they expected derision or skepticism. They simply despair of making you believe that anybody could possibly be as nice as Flagler is to all his employees. The esprit de corps is amazingly strong. He gives them a free hand. By putting them much on their honor, he also puts them on their mettle, though, after all, their chief motive-force appears to be personal loyalty.

I wish to make it very clear that I cherish no deathless illusions about men rich or poor; that, having spent my working life in Wall Street, I cannot be accused of un familiarity with either modern business methods or the personality of the great captains of industry. And now, I deliberately state that Mr. Flagler's subordinates in Florida, in charge of interests representing an actual cash outlay of more than forty millions of dollars, when deciding disputes or settling any manner of business matters, always act, not for “the good of the company” or its profit, but invariably as they think Mr. Flagler would personally act. And Mr. Flagler always decides in favor of what is just and fair and kind. I cannot say as much of any other “big man,” though it must be remembered that while other corporations have no souls, this one has, and it belongs to Henry M. Flagler. 

Only the other day an old carpenter, who had been in Mr. Flagler's employ from the early St. Augustine days, was stricken with locomotor ataxia. Well, without consulting Mr. Flagler they simply pensioned off the man, who is now provided for to the end. They wished to spare their chief the sorrow of learning of the man's misfortune, and they did what they knew he would have done. And this is merely one of many such instances. I consider this more remarkable than the green enchantment of Palm Beach or the gray grandeur of the Long Key viaduct. 

He has had these same men in his employ ment in the first instance was good. But many years. It may show that his judgment n the first instance was good. But you are surprised to hear that he never once has praised them to their faces; never expressed pleasure or gratification in their wisdom or success or fidelity to duty; never patted them on the back, never called them by their first names. And yet they all love him! He never gives positive orders. He expresses his views or his wishes; but he also asks their views and invites suggestions. If theirs are better, he promptly says: “That's better than mine. We ought to do that!" That is as near a positive order as he ever gives, and yet he is a man of decision and indomitable will. 

Flagler's Florida lieutenants told pretty the same stories. If I quote one, it is because that is substantially what all said: 

“It is natural that I, having worked under him for years, should think that Mr. Flagler is not only a very good man but great man. He has the faculty of clear, logical reasoning and a perception so keen and quick that he unerringly detects the flaw anywhere at a glance. 

"He is very careful and studies a thing thoroughly before he acts. Once he is convinced it can be done, he goes ahead with out regard to the time of the profit. Fifty months or fifty years are all the same to him, so far as profits are concerned. And he is never impatient and never discouraged. I remember, in the old days, when Seavey ran the Ponce de Leon on a magnificent scale but did not clear expenses, the hotel had a very expensive chef and a fine orchestra. Seavey wrote to Mr. Flagler in New York that under the circumstances he would discharge the chef and do away with the music. Mr. Flagler telegraphed back: 'Hire another cook and two more orchestras.' That was his way of telling the manager not to worry about the deficit. 

“I should say that he is the most modest man in the world. When the people wanted to call the new town of Miami 'Flagler,' he refused, and asked that it should keep its old name — and he had built the town. Why, this year - 1909 – when the committee wanted to give him a box at the Ponce de Leon celebration in St. Augustine, he wouldn't accept it, preferring to go on the grand stand with the crowd. They literally forced him to take the box - and you know what St. Augustine owes to him. The vestrymen of the Memorial Church had to wait until some meeting at which he was not present to vote a pew to him in perpetuity; he did not wish to accept it, preferring to be like any other pewholder - and he had built the church. “He never swears. I think ‘Thunder!' is his strongest expletive. And I have yet to hear him call any one a 'd--- fool.' The nearest he comes to it is: “Now, wouldn't you think a man would have more sense than that?" 

### $84,000 FOR A $4,000 SITE 

“He has none of the steam-roller tendencies which I hear people accuse other big men of. For instance, when he was about to build the Alcazar, which, like the Ponce de Leon, is situated on marshy ground which he filled in, the Methodist Church stood near by. It was an old building that would have been dear at $4,000, land and all. He told the congregation that if they would let him have the site, he would build them a nice church anywhere else they wished. They agreed, thinking he would deal fairly by them. They hoped that he might spend as much as $5,000 on it. Well, he built the Methodist Church and parsonage at a cost of $84,000 and gave it to them, free and clear. And that is characteristic of him. 

“One time, when in New York, he received a letter from a cripple here who was about to be foreclosed, a man too old and sickly to start life anew elsewhere with any likelihood of success. Mr. Flagler telegraphed me to go to the man's relief. The cripple lived in a settlement miles and miles from anywhere. To get to it, I had to go up the river a long distance in a launch, and the rest of the way over trails. There weren't even roads, and Mr. Flagler knew it. While on the way, a second telegram reached me saying that he had sent the money in gold certificates to Titusville. You see, he feared that the mortgagee might be some ignorant backwoodsman who would not want to take my check. 

“In the towns he has built he has begun work on a church and a schoolhouse at the same time that he began his railroad station. He says he has done this for the sake of the women. This is a level country, and settlers can live where the women-folk can have neighbors and their children schooling, while the men can ride to their plantations on bicycles. The church is the social center of the place. In towns with the development of which he has nothing to do, he always responds to appeals for schools and for churches-without respect to denomination. 

"His religion? He is a Presbyterian, but not narrow. Some of his best friends, I've heard him say, are in the Catholic hierarchy. I remember when the Memorial Church was building he ordered some palmettos from a distance, to plant about it. They did not reach St. Augustine until the very Sunday morning of the dedication. When I told him, early in the morning, that the palms had arrived, he said: "What can be better than to plant them on the day of the dedication?' and so his laborers broke the Sabbath. Some of the congregation predicted a short life for the Sabbath-desecrating palmettos. Years afterward, one Sunday morning, Mr. Flagler and I came out of the church. He looked at the palms and said to me: 'Every one of the wicked things lived!' 

“Over the entrance to the Palm Beach cemetery he has placed this inscription: 'Anything so universal as death must be a blessing.' Also this, from the 121st Psalm: 'The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.'

"I tell you, it is difficult to convey to strangers or visitors how he has worked for Florida and for the people he has brought to the East Coast. He wants them to find work, to make money. He has never gone into anything that local capital would or could do. Nobody else would build the rail road, because it would not pay; nor the hotels; nor the waterworks and electric-light plant in Miami; and so he did. But he won't, for instance, even run the stage line in St. Augustine, nor permit his hotels to do a livery business, because other people can make a living at it. 

“Kindly and considerate as he is, he also is the most self-repressed man living. Hang it, man, the day Judge Grosscup reversed the famous Landis decision fining the Standard Oil $29,000,000, the news reached one of Mr. Flagler's trusted lieutenants. He went into Mr. Flagler's office to tell him about it. This man knows more about Mr. Flagler's business than any other living man and has been with him many years. Nevertheless he thought it wise to carry a bunch of papers, as a sort of excuse for being also the bearer of news. Think of it! Yet he was, after all, afraid to speak about the decision and was going out with out saying a word. But at the door he turned and, in desperation, blurted out: 'To tell you the truth, Mr. Flagler, I really came in to tell you that Judge Grosscup has reversed the Landis decision. The $29,000,000 fine does not stand.' Now, Mr. Flagler had said all along that the fine was gross in justice. He felt very strongly about it. For a moment he looked as if he were going to say something. But he merely nodded and then said casually: 'Mr. -----, do you happen to have those Whitehall plumbing bills handy?' 

"I do not know whether I have helped you to form an estimate of Mr. Flagler. His innermost self? I don't know it. He keeps it under lock and key.” 

And it was the same story everywhere. Respect, admiration, affection; but not knowledge of the man. 

I decided to let him explain himself. 

He received me in “Whitehall,” his Palm Beach palace - a beautiful house set amidst beautiful grounds. Without, flowers and shrubs and green grass and the wonderful sky; within, magnificence - and good taste. 

I saw an old man with a high forehead rising in straight lines from the temples. His hair is of a clean, glistening silver, like the cropped mustache and the eyebrows. They set off his complexion, which is neither ruddy nor baby-pink, but what one might call a virile red. He has a straight nose and a strong chin. The head is well shaped; that is, without phrenological over-accentuations. The eyes are a clear blue - some might say violet. They must have been very keen once; to-day their expression is not easy to describe - not exactly shrewd nor compelling nor suspicious, though you feel they might have been all these, years ago. Withal, you are certain that it is not age which has mellowed them; the change is more subtle; it is from within - eyes that gleam but never flame. Between his eyebrows there is an inverted V, deep-wrinkled; you think of it as a sort of chronic frown, which persists even though the cause of it disappeared decades ago. A handsome old man! Under his fourscore years his shoulders have bowed slightly, but there is no semblance of decay.

### FLAGLER - A MAN ALONE 

You see in his face good concentration; good observation, without undue alertness; meditation without self-abstraction; attentiveness without tension; indomitable will without stubbornness; a steady-gaited man, deliberate not from age nor from indifference, but from temperament and life habit. But the most remarkable thing about him is the curious sense of difference rather than mere aloofness. There is no superciliousness, no impatience, no hint of superiority; yet you are subtly made aware that he is alone, by himself. His forehead suggests the facade of a strange temple. What there is within no human being knows. You think of his mind as a machine, prodigiously powerful, that works without a hitch, without sensational bursts of speed, without an eccentric in the entire engine, always steady, precise, automatic, cool, perfectly lubricated, marvelously adjusted, beautifully compensated. And the motive power comes from - where? I do not know. But one can always say: From God! 

After you have become acquainted with him, you find a man who talks freely, yet never freely enough; who answers everything, but volunteers nothing. You are not guilty of a “bull” when you say of him that he talks taciturnly. His speech is deliberate, but he never drawls; a business man without the fidgets of a “hustler.” You realize that there is no life-habit of caution; you get no impression of a man perennially on his guard, as in John D. Rockefeller; he is calm and kindly; never distant - and always at a distance. 

### A STATUE WITH VEINS 

You realize that you are before a man who has suffered and has never wept; who has undergone intense pain and has never sobbed; who has never bent under stress and has never hurrahed! When a man has one or another group of salient traits, you place him in a certain pigeonhole of human classification. Your great man is apt to be one with certain faculties over-developed, and classifies easily. But Flagler is not like any one else and withal is not eccentric. He is without redeeming vices, without amiable inconsistencies, without obsessions. He simply does not “classify.” You cannot accurately adjectivize him. He does not defy analysis; he baffles it. It is as if the soul of him, condensed, compressed by environment, or heredity, or some great natural force not by self-effort - had been molded into a statue, full of vitality, yet immobile; a statue with veins. Whether they run red blood you cannot tell; but you are certain it is not ice water. What ichor is it, then? 

That is the mystery of the soul of Henry M. Flagler. 

“Sit here, on this lounge, beside me. I will let you have my good ear. It is none too good at that,” he said, and made room for me beside him, the first time I saw him. 

I asked him many questions. He answered every one promptly; I received no definite impression of the man. It does not often happen. Silence is the best guard against self-betrayal. With this man it was speech. And yet he was frank. The conversation ran like this: 

“Do you do thus and so?” 

“Sometimes.” 

“Do you like this?” 

“Oh, yes.” 

“Are you fond of that?” 

"Yes; somewhat.” Always with a quiet voice, neither bored nor interested. 

“How did you build your system?” 

"Oh, it's one of those things that just happen. I happened to be in St. Augustine and had some spare money.” 

“You must have thought a good hotel was needed.” 

“I suppose so," very simply. 

“You think ten times to one of talking?" 

“I've talked you black and blue.” 

“But you do think ten times more than you speak?” 

“I suppose so.” There is no weariness in the “I suppose so.” It isn't languid, it isn't tired; no indifference, no interest. He accepts facts without thrills. 

“How did you achieve your success in business?" 

"All I can say is by working six days a week.” He does not seem to have any maxims or business aphorisms. 

“How do you manage to have such health at your age?” 

"When I answer friends who ask me that same question, they laugh. But I mean it. When I was young I was too poor to indulge in bad habits. By the time I was able to afford them, it had become a fixed habit to live simply.” 

Only now and then are you made conscious that he is of an earlier generation. Thus, in answer to another question: 

“I have studied the price men pay for success—the loss of health or of character or of reputation.' And I find that all men who win success, no matter how they win it, are always met with envy. That accounts for many of the attacks you mention.” 

“Why should that be?” 

“Poor human nature, I suppose." He has not grasped the reason for our muckraking. 

On a trip to Indian River, years ago, he met a squatter, a Jerseyman who had gone for his health and was growing all manner of fruits and vegetables, including pineapples, of which he had secured the slips on a trip he once made to the Bahamas. 

“He told me," said Flagler, “that the apple Eve tempted Adam with must have been a pineapple. When I saw how this man was growing all sorts of sub-tropical fruits, I thought that what he could do others could do, and that it ought to pay. decided to give them a chance to do it by building a railroad. It was forlorn-looking country. If I hadn't seen that Jerseyman, I'd never have believed it could be done. But I decided it was a good thing." 

“And you were right.”

"A fool for luck," he explained, not jocularly, not seriously. 

It took imagination and business sense to see profitable labor in this unprepossessing wilderness. I tried to get at the vividness of his vision and at the faculty his friends said he had of seeing a work in its utter com pletion even before commencing it. 

"When you thought about it, in the old days, could you close your eyes and see the railroad finished ?" 

"Yes.” He spoke in a matter-of-fact tone. 

“Please understand me. Don't let me suggest it to you. Did you actually vision to yourself the whole thing? I mean, did you, or could you, really close your eyes and see the tracks? And the trains running? And hear the whistles blowing? Did you go as far as that?" 

“Yes." 

"How clearly?” 

"Very clearly." 

"Did you merely think you might get settlers to come, once they had a railroad, or did you actually assume it? Or did you again close your eyes and see the men in the field working? Did you really vision the thing as clearly as that?"

“Yes." 

"Did you build the railroad because you thought it would pay some day?” 

"No." 

Why then?” 

"I thought then, and know now, that no where else in this country can a man get more pay for his labor than here. You know, we grow no staples; only luxuries. And luxuries are bought by people who can afford to pay good prices. Then, a man can keep busy here nearly the entire year; the planting of one crop follows the harvest ing of another, according to the season. The railroad enabled people to come here and work, and ship their produce, and get paid for it." 

"It wasn't to make money for yourself?” 

"If it wasn't for Florida, I'd be quite a rich man to-day.” 

“Will you tell me why you did this work here?" 

"Yes; I'll tell you. The hardest problem a man has is how to help people. This de sire to help others comes when a man has more than enough for his own needs. I have come to the conclusion that the best way to help others is to help them to help themselves." He said it with a matter-of fact earnestness, as one might allude to an indisputable fact. And I knew he was not merely speaking for publication. 

“When you saw so clearly what your work would mean to the East Coast of Florida, didn't the vision thrill you?” 

“No.” 

“How did you feel?" 

“Just as I do now.” 

“You don't seem to care to talk about yourself." 

“I prefer to let what I have done speak for me. 

“By their works ye shall know them,” I suggested. 

"Yes; that's it,” he said eagerly; as eagerly as he ever says anything. 

"And is this self-obliteration, what some might call self-repression, natural or quired? How do you come by it? What was your early life?” 

It was a great deal to ask of a man in his eightieth year in his own home. He answered this even more freely than the other questions:

### THE TOP NOTCH OF RESERVE 

“I suppose it is. inherited. I was born in Hope, near Canandaigua, New York, in 1830. I realize how this country has grown when I remember that in the year I was born there were exactly twenty-four miles of railroad in all the United States. My father was a Presbyterian clergyman. When I was fourteen I realized that, with his small salary, it was all he could do to take care of himself, to say nothing of my mother and my sister. So I went to the edge of what was then called the Western Reserve, to Bellevue, in northern Ohio. I worked there. Some years later my father and mother joined me. After a while he retired from the ministry. 

“My mother died in 1861. I was then thirty-one. The local paper published the customary obituary notice, and I got several copies and sent them to friends back in New York State, who had known mother. I told my father about it and asked him if there was any one else to whom he thought I ought to send a copy of the paper. He thought a long time-quite a long time. Finally he said: “Yes, you might send a copy to Mrs. So-and-So,' somewhere out in Indiana, I think. I did so; and asked him if he thought of any one else. Again hethought-a long time—and at last he said: “Yes. You might send a copy to Mrs. another name, in Kansas. I did so, and asked him if those were all he could think of. He said they were. I'd never heard those names, and I asked him if these ladies knew mother well. 'I think so,' he said. “Who are they, father?' I asked him; and he said: “They are my sisters.' Several years afterward, when a cousin in Canandaigua was getting up a history of the Flagler family, I learned for the first time that my father was one of twelve children. So I suppose I inherited from him my dislike of speaking about myself.” I asked him what the “M” in his name stood for, and he replied: "Morrison. My mother was Scotch. The first time I ever used my middle name was ten years ago, when the Governor of Bahama wished to know, on account of a contract between my self and the British Government. He cabled me: 'How do you spell it?' and I didn't know. I wasn't sure whether there was one 'r' or two.” He was only seventy years old and had never thought about his middle name! In "Whitehall," during one of my visits, I remarked on the charming color scheme of, I think, the drawing-room, and I learned it was his own suggestion to his decorators. 

“How did the idea come to you?” 

“I don't know. I just thought it would look well." 

“You have the aesthetic sense well de veloped ?” 

“I don't know.” And then he told me that he had differed with his architects only once. It was about the height of the ceil ing of the great hall. They wanted it higher, to secure the right proportions. “But I wanted to feel at home, and so I made them put it eight feet lower. I can come here and sit down and feel that it is The Italian ambassador told me that I had something the Old World had not; and that was a palace to be lived in. That was what I wanted-a home.” And, char acteristically, it was built in eight months. He himself decided everything. I remember, after he had shown me through “Whitehall,” and I had congratu lated him on its beauty, that he led me to a panel of Honduras mahogany that hung, picture-like, from the wall; a beautiful slab of wood, exquisite in color and marvelously grained. He turned to me and said: “I often look at this house that I built and had decorated by artists. Then I look at this panel. I am going to put on it: 'What God hath wrought.'" 

But all this did not give me the insight into the man that I desired. The clues came later. 

“Mr. Flagler, which do you enjoy more, planning work or doing it?" 

“There isn't much fun in work if you don't accomplish something." 

The second was: “Which do you consider the hardest thing you have done in Florida ?” 

“Building the Ponce de Leon. Here was St. Augustine, the oldest city in the United States. How to build a hotel to meet the requirements of nineteenth-century America and have it in keeping with the character of the place—that was my hardest problem. The Alcazar I built because it was suggested to me that there were many nice people who might not be able to afford to pay the rates the Ponce de Leon would have to ask, and yet wished to enjoy St. Augustine. To provide accommodations for them, we built the Alcazar as a two-dollar-a-day house. It is every bit as good as the Ponce de Leon.”

### A MAN WITH TWO YOUTHS 

On the night of the Ponce de Leon celebration in St. Augustine last spring, I met him in the courtyard of the hotel. He was standing by the fountain. The sky was like the inside of a huge, hollow turquoise--blue, luminous, thinly washed with silver. The moon was very bright; so near the earth that it seemed more neighborly than in the North. A mist as of vaporized moon-metal enveloped the buildings and made them unforgettably beautiful. The grounds were illuminated; you could have sworn the lights were captive fireflies. The palms resembled ghosts of women with disheveled hair. The fountain splashed droningly. You heard no other sound. 

For perhaps five minutes he stood there; at length he turned to me and murmured: 

“This is beautiful! Beautiful!" 

That was the time and place from which, beginning at his eightieth year, I walked back twenty years, to the beginning of the second youth of Henry M. Flagler. 

Little is known of Flagler's early youth. He is temperamentally averse to reminiscences. But Flagler himself told me that hewent to the district school and learned all there was to be learned there; also--you recall--that he left his home at fourteen be cause he thought it was his duty not to be a burden to his father. He knew no trade and probably did not fancy any. When he went to northern Ohio in 1844, he became a clerk in a country store. He worked hard -six days a week. In time he became a partner in the firm, and the firm in turn became, among other things, the principal grain shipper in Bellevue. 

### FLAGLER BEFORE STANDARD OIL DAYS 

In the early sixties he and his partner be came interested in salt-wells in Saginaw, Michigan. It was at the time of the salt craze, and fabulous fortunes were going to be made in that business. After some years of ups and downs the partners failed. A very old friend of his told me he recalled hearing Flagler say, forty-odd years ago, that he owed $30,000, and that if he ever paid off his debts and was $10,000 ahead, he would retire from business. At all events, after his Michigan failure he spent a year in Cleveland working at various things. He was interested in a machine for making horseshoes, which was never perfected. He also tried to do a grain commission business. John D. Rocke feller, then a bookkeeper, he met in the office of ex-Mayor George W. Gardner in Cleve land, who was a grain shipper and as such knew and liked Flagler from the old Bellevue days. It was a period of poverty and des pondency. His wife's uncle became inter ested in him and supplied the money-so I am informed by old-timers—with which Flagler joined the others in forming the oil firm of Rockefeller, Flagler, and Andrews. He was close to his fortieth year; close to that period of life when a man is at his maxi mum efficiency; but also, an age at which a man has acquired the equipment with which to command whatever success is to come to him. He merely "found himself” somewhat later in life than is usual with men. Mentally he has grown in the same deliberate manner in which he does everything; and as thor oughly. 

The oil business was profitable from the start, and his mind first grasped its vast possibilities. He was responsible for the formation of the Standard Oil Company. It was too profitable a business to be dependent on the life of any one of the partners, so he urged the incorporation. When John D. Rockefeller was asked on the witness stand if it was he who conceived the idea, he answered: “No, sir. I wish I'd had the brains to think of it. It was Henry M. Flagler.” 

It was in the conduct of the oil business that Flagler's mind developed its fortune winning traits. His “arrival” was as inevitable as the succession of the seasons. He did not philosophize about business; but he grasped details amazingly and thought in fundamentals. It was the precise-minded Flagler who drew up the agreements that made millions. 

In the Standard Oil Company's gigantic growth, grave problems were met and dealt with-and dealt with, it seems to us outsiders, from the point of view of business expediency and corporate profit. The business, from its very magnitude and ramifications, inevitably had its political, no less than its financial and commercial and industrial phases. In his passion for stability and permanence and efficiency, how much there was of ruthlessness in what Flagler did I do not know, nor how far he went in that auto-hypnotization practiced by the great captains of industry, in whose plans you always find the emotionless belief that the end justifies the means. If the philosophy of his life was to crystallize at all, it surely should have done so by his fiftieth year. Under the compulsion of environment and of those long years when he and his associates were perfecting the organization of the company, one might logically expect that same philosophy to smell of petroleum, of the life-blood of competitors, to be tinged with the bitterness that comes to a man perennially on the defensive. But moneymaking never was a passion with him, though efficiency was. His mental machinery did his work for him in the manner in which all efficient machinery works. But the motive power did not come from the soul of the man. WHY FLAGLER ISN'T THE SECOND RICHEST MAN 

Past his half-century, Flagler, a clearheaded, calm-eyed man, found himself enormously rich. The profits of the oil business had been put back into the business. But the inevitable day came when there was no need for further investment. The moneymaking machine was not only perfect; it was permanent. The only concern of its engi-neers was now personal: What to do with the profits? His yearly income was in itself a princely fortune—and growing princelier. Outside investments must be sought. John D. Rockefeller became the richest man in the world. Flagler says: “If it wasn't for Florida, I'd be quite a rich man to-day.” It is characteristic of men who see clearly and think in straight lines that they have no illusions about their capabilities or those of others. Flagler says that at fifty-five he “had the sense to see that younger men in the company could run the business better, if they had the chance.” And at about that same time he went to St. Augustine for a rest, accompanied by his daughter, who was not well. If it had not been for that visit at that time, he might perhaps to-day be the second richest man in the world. 

### FROM OHIO WHEAT TO FLORIDA PALMS 

His personal habits had always been simple. They tell me he carried his lunch to his office daily for years, even after he was a million aire; not from excessive frugality so much as from absorption in his work and from that curious half-shyness, half-modesty of his. The wife of his youth was an invalid. Every night, when his work was done, he went home. He would read to her; or, if she were too fatigued, he would sit in the adjoining room and read to himself. In seventeen years this man, who was well liked by his fellows, spent but two evenings away from his home. Two nights in seventeen years! Diversion, distraction from business cares, information he found in books read aloud to an invalid wife and silently to himself. 

At first blush, it seems curious that this man, with his genius for detail, his broad grasp of essentials, his remarkable sense of fundamentals, his vivid imagination, and a very highly developed creative impulse, a man who never was really selfish nor self centered, up to his sixtieth year found more pleasure in things than in men. think about it, it is not strange at all. •Inessentials never entered into his scheme of things. He found men ready-made; and saw industrial processes in embryo. He said to me: "I never want to leave a thing un finished”; and he was very busy with his Standard Oil Company. His life's philosophy he left unfinished until an age when the shadow of the cemetery gates falls athwart a man's consciousness. 

What we call knowledge is not merely the collection, but the proper classification, of facts. This man's years, from the thirty-fifth to the fifty-fifth, were spent in business- on the defensive against certain men, in the offensive against other men. It was so strenuous, so remarkable a business experience, that he could not come into that intimate contact with his fellows necessary to acquire the essential facts about them; nor had he the leisure to classify such facts into real knowledge. The oil that the power of his mind transformed into wealth shaped itself into the one unscalable fence of all--a fence of solid gold, exactly man-high! 

In all his life he has never been in Europe, nor even in California. He told me once: “If ever the Lord made a man who hated traveling, I am that man!" But he had read books, he was fond of history. His thirst for information made him interested in beautiful and strange places, even though he preferred to imagine what they were like rather than to visit them. He had grown up with his own country. And in Ohio, where he lived from boyhood till middle age, he had seen about him only the new, the raw, the man-made things of today. Yet antiquity and the works of antiquity had for him a peculiar fascination. You must bear in mind also that there is a well-developed vein of sentiment in him. He himself probably is not aware of it; but he has it. Nor does it show inconsistency. 

And so this man of fifty-five, so rich that his most serious problem was how to invest his income, this man who had read a great deal and had never traveled, went to St. Augustine. It was the oldest city in the United States. He saw the old slave market, he saw the old Spanish fort; he saw the old city gates! He saw what you and I saw when we went to Pompeii or first gazed on the Pyramids! He saw palms- palms/—this man who had grown up in Ohio amid the wheat. St. Augustine was a magic pool; he steeped his soul in the glamour and romance of antiquity. 

It was to him, logically enough, the most interesting place he had ever seen, the most unusual, the most un-American. Why didn't more people come to it? This Spanish city was three hundred years old; and the city of Cleveland, Ohio—why, he was as old as Cleveland, almost. 

The reason why more people didn't come to St. Augustine was that the hotel accom-modations were not first-class. Nobody would build hotels, because they might not pay. Flagler had more money than he knew what to do with. He decided to build a hotel. He thought it might pay, when people learned about St. Augustine. They might take a long time to learn. But did that matter to a man with his millions? And so, while it was business-for he felt sure of eventual success-it wasn't Standard Oil business. And it wasn't altogether play. It was the new point of view that made it seem like a whim to so many people at the time and that makes it still arouse suspicion among some. Remember he said: “My hardest problem was the Ponce de Leon: How to build a hotel to meet the requirements of nineteenth-century America and yet be in keeping with the character of the place!" He gave the commission to a firm of then un known young architects—Carrère & Hast ings. He set no limits to cost. It was built by day's labor-as a rich man might build his own house if he really were interested in a home. The best site for such a hotel was a certain swamp. Maria Sanchez Creek ran through what is now the Alcazar. So even the ground was built by him that his scheme might go through in its artistic entirety. 

It is perfectly obvious that in building Ponce de Leon and the Alcazar he began to emancipate his mind from the thralldom of the Oil trust, to awaken the dormant æsthetic sense and develop it by gratification, to shift a little from the center of his point of view. The blue sky began to take on the meaning it has for human beings who have time to look at it. 

There still remained for him to get closer to his fellow-men. Tourists to whom the climate of St. Au gustine and the beauty and comfort of the Flagler hotels there would appeal, were the kind that dislike unnecessary discomforts in traveling. Flagler naturally endeavored to induce the ramshackle railroad from Jacksonville to St. Augustine to mend its way. But it was a poor road, poorly managed Lacking profitable traffic, it would remain ramshackle forever. In the end, Flagler purchased the railroad. In the transforma tion of "a streak of rust and a right of way” through a wilderness, into an efficient rail road; in the development of sandy wastes, sparsely settled, into a productive country with a self-supporting population, there are all the thrills and all the inspiration such a mind as Flagler's needs. And now his Florida work was no longer exclusively the outcome of his sentimental love of beautiful skies and admiration for exotic plants, or reverence for the near antiquity of St. Augustine. He became interested in agricultural development. He saw what great possibilities in orange growing. He decided to extend and improve his railroads --not gradually, as the profits justified, but at once, for he had the money and no need to wait for profits. So he had engineers survey a line for a railroad, and built into an undeveloped wilderness. And people came and planted orange trees. 

There was a frost. It killed most of the fruit trees—and also killed the last of the old Flagler. He promptly went to the scene of the disaster, in order to consider intelligently what to do. And there he saw for himself how people whom his railroad had induced to come here and invest money and devote time and labor to develop the country, had lost. It was not his fault. It was the worst frost on record, and the planters were too new at it to know how to protect their trees against the cold. Their investment in dollars was a drop beside his own. But he saw for himself human suffering, he met his fellow-men close enough to look into their the eyes. He reverted to his first youth, to the time when he was very poor, before he was even a partner in a country store. It was then that his philosophy of life began to crystallize, slowly at first; more rapidly as he saw more and more of men, as he saw them trying to benefit directly by his own work. Having great wealth, he decided there was but one thing to do: Extend his railroad still farther south, where orange growers would be less at the mercy of Jack Frost.

### FLAGLER'S. MAGIC FOUNTAIN 

He would do this to help others! Logical, clear-sighted, immune from greed, and free from emotionalism, a six-days-a-week worker from his youth, realizing the value of opportunity to men, he now reached the conclusion that the best way to help others was to help them to help themselves. The desire to help he might long have had; it was intensified, made definite, by the sight of the distress caused by the blighting of the oranges, 

That is why Flagler decided to push south; and there it was that he found the Magic that Fountain of his Second Youth! 

He built the Palm Beach hotel to getpassenger traffic. He did not care so much for the tourists as for the fruit growers now. Therefore in Palm Beach he did not take the interest in the Royal Poinciana Hotel, architecturally, that he did in the Ponce de Leon. He gratified his love of beauty with the marvel ous grounds, in the making of a garden spot. And again the frost came. trees were killed, perversely, in what up to that time had been a section safe from "freezes," somebody showed him a spray of lemon blossoms from near Miami. The lemon tree is even more delicate than the orange. So he carried his railroad to Miami. He built the town. He felt safe there. He would see a city below the frost belt. He laid it out, when he should have been think ing of the City Beautiful. But had he not found his Second Youth ? When Cuba became a republic, it was evident that under American influences it would develop fast. Friends tried to induce him to build a chain of Flagler hotels on the Island; but he declined. I myself think it was too much of a money-making scheme to move him. His views were more serious; if he worked at all, he would do a man's work; not merely a capitalist's. But he did think of extending the railroad to Key West. When it became certain that the United States would build the Panama Canal, he sent for his engineers. And the amazing railroad among the Keys followed. 

I do not know whether I have succeeded in making clear what I mean by saying that in Florida Henry M. Flagler found his Second Youth and was able to do a work that only youth ever does. It is an amazing work, even in this land of rapid development. Where others have helped, he has forced, growth. That it is a work of vast importance is obvious. That it is unique is due to the impossibility of finding a man of Flagler's mind and Flagler's wealth and Flagler's business experience, having the attitude of Flagler toward his fellow-men. To my mind his most remarkable exploit was the changing of his own point of view, of his attitude toward his fellow-men, so pletely, at so advanced an age. You must admit that he has done as a man in his prime does. It is easy to give; it is not easy to give as Flagler has given--money and service. And if the magnitude of his accomplishment grows the more you ponder it, so does the man's character appear more remarkable the more you reflect. It is therefore not so difficult, after all, to visualize the man as he is to-day, at eighty years, in the flower of his Second Youth. 

I shall never forget the last time I saw him. It was in Palm Beach. A supernally beautiful day! ... Now that the end was coming, the heavens took on marvelous tints. From the dark fringe of trees on the opposite shore of Lake Worth palest greens shaded upward into incredibly delicate blues. Veils of fire opal had been drawn across the sky and then rent. You saw tatters of incandescent gold, topazine splendors in shreds. The clouds grew faintly pink, then rosy, with tints almost of dawn. To the south the sky was a plowed field; the furrow-slices were of molten fire, and in the depths of the furrows, as though it were shallow soil, the sky showed through in streaks of beryl and aquamarine and turquoise. In the east, where the sun's cloudplowing had not yet begun, the sky remained a stupendous meadow of amethyst. 

All that day I had tried to catch a glimpse of this man's soul-in vain. And now, in the loggia of his palace, looking out to where Lake Worth, expecting the night airs, bad covered its bare blue bosom with silver-cloth, and, beyond that, to where the dark green tree-fringe was spotting itself with inky shadows, I turned to this old, old man who had done so much and had talked so little; and, forgetting all differences-in age and experience and ideals and point of view-I asked him, I fear impatiently: 

“Doesn't this sky get into your soul? Doesn't that glow light it? Don't you love that water, that line of trees, that sky? Isn't this the real reason why you do things bere?” 

He turned to me, hesitated; then, very slowly, very quietly, he said: “Sometimes, at the close of day, when I am fortunate enough to be alone, I come here.” He faced Lake Worth and was silent. Then: “I look at the water and at the trees yonder and at the sunset.” He turned to me and placed his hand on my shoulder. Then, earnestly, almost wistfully: “I often wonder if there is anything in the other world so beautiful as this." 

I saw him, a tall, sturdy figure, snowcrowned, looking at the lake over whose mid-day turquoise dusk had spread a silver rug-wrinkled in places, for the night winds had come. 

I did not say good-by to this man. The sun said it for me.
